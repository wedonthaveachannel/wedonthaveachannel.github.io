	Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV’s finance minister in the first years of his reign, was a
generous man who loved lavish parties, pretty women, and poetry.
He also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle. Fouquet was
clever and very much indispensable to the king, so when the prime mim's—
ter, Jules Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister expected to be
named the successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This
and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and
so he decided to ingraliate himself with the king by staging the most spectacular
party the world had ever seen. The party’s ostensible purpose would be to
commemorate the completion of Fouquet’s chateau, Vaux—le Vicomte, but its
real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of
honor.
		
The most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds
of the Iime—La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sévigné—
attended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he
himself was to perform at the evening’s conclusion. The party began with a
lavish seven—course dinner, featuring foods from the Orient never before
tasted in France, as well as new dishes created especially for the night.
The meal was accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet to
honor the king.
		
After dinner there was a promenade through the chateau’s gardens.
The grounds and fountains of Vaux—le»Vicomte were to be the inspiration
for Versailles. Fouquet personally accompanied the young king through the
geometrically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arriving at the
gardens’ canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was followed by
the performance of Moliere’s play. The party ran well into the night and
everyone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever attended.
		
The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king’s head musketeer,
D’Artagna.n. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the
country’s treasury. (Actually, most of the stealing he was accused of he had
done on the kings behalf and with the king’s permission.) Fouquet was
found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the
Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in solitary confinement.
